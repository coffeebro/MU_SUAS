# What is SUAS?
The <a href="http://www.auvsi-suas.org">AUVSI SUAS</a> competition is held annualy at a U.S. Navy air base.  One of the primary goals of the competition is to autonomously capture and assess the characteristics of targets scattered across the competition area.  This task simulates how unmanned systems might be used for ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) in the real world.
